**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
#NEXT
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=

#APPWRITE
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=
APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=
APPWRITE_USER_COLLECTION_ID=
APPWRITE_BANK_COLLECTION_ID=
APPWRITE_TRANSACTION_COLLECTION_ID=
APPWRITE_SECRET=

#PLAID
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=
PLAID_SECRET=
PLAID_ENV=
PLAID_PRODUCTS=
PLAID_COUNTRY_CODES=

#DWOLLA
DWOLLA_KEY=
DWOLLA_SECRET=
DWOLLA_BASE_URL=https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com
DWOLLA_ENV=sandbox

```


**Running the Project**

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
